## Architecture Overview

The project's architecture is driven by **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles and implements **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**. This approach organizes the codebase to align closely with the business domain, separating operations that change state (Commands) from operations that read state (Queries).

*   **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic, entities, aggregates, value objects, and domain services. It is the heart of the application and has no dependencies on other layers.
*   **Application Layer**: Orchestrates domain objects to fulfill use cases (commands and queries). It defines application services, command handlers, and query handlers. It depends on the Domain layer.
*   **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides implementations for interfaces defined in the Domain and Application layers (e.g., database repositories, external service clients, authentication providers). It depends on the Application and Domain layers.
*   **Interfaces Layer (Presentation)**: Handles external communication, typically REST APIs. It defines controllers, API
    resources, and assemblers for transforming between API models and application/domain models. It depends on the Application layer.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Concepts

The project embraces DDD to manage complexity in its core business domains:

*   **Bounded Contexts**: The application is explicitly divided into `IAM`, `Profiles`,
    and `Publishing` bounded contexts, each with its own ubiquitous language and domain model.
*   **Aggregates**: Key domain objects like `Tutorial` (in Publishing) and `User` (in IAM) are defined as aggregate roots. They encapsulate a cluster of domain objects (entities and value objects) and
    ensure transactional consistency within their boundaries.
*   **Entities**: Objects with a distinct identity that runs through time and different representations (e.g., `Category`, `Asset`).
*   **Value Objects**: Objects that measure, quantify, or describe a thing in the domain and are immutable (e.g.,
    `FullName`, `EmailAddress`, `StreetAddress` in Profiles). They are compared by their values, not their identity.
*   **Domain Services**: Operations that don't naturally fit within an entity or value object (e.g., `ITokenService`, `IHashingService` in IAM).

## Key Features & Best Practices Implemented

*   **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Commands are used to update data, and Queries are used to retrieve data. This separation allows for independent scaling and optimization of read and write models.
*   **Cancellation Tokens**: Integrated across all asynchronous operations (application services, repositories, controllers, middleware) to enable graceful cancellation of long-running tasks, improving responsiveness and resource management.
*   **Refined Error Management**:
    *   **`Result<T>` Pattern**: Used consistently in application services to
        explicitly represent success or failure
        of an operation, avoiding exceptions for control flow.
    *   **Domain-Specific Error Enums**: Strongly-typed enums (e.g., `IamError`, `ProfilesError`, `PublishingError`) provide clear, categorized error codes
        for business rule violations.
    *   **Localized Error Messages**: Error messages are externalized into `.resx` files and retrieved via `IStringLocalizer`, supporting multiple languages.
    *   **RFC 7807 Problem Details**: All API error responses adhere to this standard, providing machine-readable and
        consistent error information to
        clients.
    *   **Global Exception Handling Middleware**: Catches unhandled exceptions, logs them, and returns standardized `ProblemDetails` responses, preventing sensitive information leakage.
*   **Internationalization (i18n)**:
    *   **Decentralized Resources**: `.resx
` files are
        organized within the `Resources` folder of each
        bounded context, aligning with modularity principles.
    *   **`IStringLocalizer`**: Used throughout the application for dynamic retrieval of localized strings.
    *   **Culture Negotiation**: Configured to determine the user's preferred language from query strings
        , cookies, or `Accept-Language` headers
        .
*   **Clean API Design with `ActionResultAssemblers`**:
    *   **Thin Controllers**: Controllers are kept lean, focusing on request handling and delegating response formatting.
    *   **Static Assemblers**: Dedicated static assembler classes (e
        .g., `IamActionResultAssembler`,
        `PublishingActionResultAssembler`) encapsulate the logic for transforming `Result<T>` objects into `IActionResult`s, including mapping error enums to HTTP status codes and generating localized `ProblemDetails`. This centralizes response logic and ensures consistency.
*   **Persistence**: Util
    izes Entity Framework Core for data access, supporting
    MySQL databases.
*   **Messaging/Mediation**: Employs Cortex.Mediator for handling commands and publishing domain events, promoting loose coupling between components.
*   **Authentication & Authorization**: Implements JWT-based authentication with custom middleware
    for request authorization.

## Bounded Contexts

The application is logically divided into the following Bounded Contexts, each managing a specific area of the business domain:

### IAM (Identity and Access Management)

The IAM Bounded Context is responsible for all aspects of user identity, authentication, and access control within the platform. It provides the
foundational security mechanisms for the entire application.

*   **Scope**: User authentication, registration, authorization, and token management.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   **User Registration**: Allows new users to securely sign up and create accounts.
    *   **User Authentication**: Handles user sign-in
        , verifying credentials (username/password), and issuing secure JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for subsequent authorized access.
    *   **Token Management**: Generates, validates,
        and manages the lifecycle of JWTs, ensuring secure session management.
    *   **Password Hashing**: Securely stores
        user passwords using robust, industry-standard hashing algorithms (BCrypt).
    *   **User Management**: Provides functionalities for retrieving and managing user accounts (e.g., fetching user details by ID or username).
*   **Aggregates**: `User`
*   **Domain Services**: `ITokenService` (
    for JWT operations), `IHashingService` (for password security)
*   **API Endpoints**: `/api/v1/authentication` (for sign-in/sign-
    up), `/api/v1/users` (for user queries)

### Profiles

The Profiles Bounded Context manages the
personal and contact information associated with users. It focuses on maintaining accurate, consistent, and complete user profiles, which are distinct from their authentication credentials handled by IAM.

*   **Scope**: Management of user-specific personal and contact details.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   **Profile Creation & Retrieval**:
        Allows users to create and retrieve their personal profiles.
    *   **Personal Information Management**: Stores and manages details such as first name, last name, and email address.
    *   **Contact Information Management**: Handles street address details including street, number, city, postal code, and country.
    *   **Data
        Integrity**: Ensures that profile data adheres to defined business rules and formats.
*   **Aggregates**: `Profile`
*   **Value Objects**: `FullName`, `EmailAddress`, `StreetAddress` (ensuring immutability and conceptual integrity of these data points)
*   **API Endpoints**: `/api/v1/profiles`

### Publishing

The Publishing Bounded Context is dedicated to the
creation, organization, and management of educational content, such as tutorials and their associated assets. It defines the entire lifecycle of content from initial creation to approval and publication.

*   **Scope**: Content creation, organization,
    asset management, and publishing workflow.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   **Content Creation**: Enables the creation of new tutorials with titles, summaries, and categorization.
    *   **Category Management**: Provides functionalities to organize tutorials into logical categories, facilitating content discovery.
    *   **Asset Management**:
        Handles various types of content assets (images, videos, readable content items) that compose a tutorial, managing their status and content.
    *   **Publishing Workflow**: Manages the status of tutorials and their assets through different stages (e.g., Draft, ReadyToEdit, ReadyToApproval, ApprovedAnd
        Locked), ensuring content quality and review processes.
*   **Aggregates**: `Tutorial` (which includes its assets as part of its consistency boundary)
*   **Entities**: `Category`, `Asset` (with specializations like `VideoAsset`, `ImageAsset`, `ReadableContentAsset`)
*   **API Endpoints**: `/api/v1/categories`, `/api/v1/tutorials`
